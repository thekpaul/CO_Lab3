# [Lab 3] Branch Prediction Hardware

## Introduction

Branch prediction plays an important role in improving the performance of modern CPUs. The goal of this lab is to improve the performance of your pipelined CPU by adding branch hardware to your design. 

## Part 0:  Lab 3 Set Up 

Lab 3 builds on your previous design from Lab 2.  First, clone this repo to your local machine and copy the following files from Lab 2 to Lab 3.
```
- src/simple_cpu.v
- src/modules/control/*.v
- src/modules/operation/*.v
- src/modules/memory/data_memory.v
- src/modules/memory/*_reg.v
```

The data memory size needs to be increased for Lab 3. Change `MEM_ADDR_SIZE` to 13 in `data_memory.v`
```verilog
module data_memory #(
  parameter DATA_WIDTH = 32, MEM_ADDR_SIZE = 13
)(
```

Now, if you can compile Lab 3 via `make`, you are ready to move onto Part I. Before that you may need to check if your code can pass the unit test up to `task5` by running `test.py` as below.

```
Linux> python test.py --test=unit
```

## Part I: Enable Full RV32I Support

In this lab, you will run **real** RV32I programs on your CPU design. Isn't it exciting? :) To do so, the first step is to implement the U-type instructions (`lui` and `auipc`) in your pipelined CPU from the previous lab. 

Below are the U-type instruction format and the semantics of each instruction. Please refer to the RISC-V materials that we had provided before for further details.

```
opcode: LUI (0110111) / AUIPC (0010111)
------------------------------------------
|      imm[31:12]      |  rd  |  opcode  |
------------------------------------------
|          20          |   5  |    7     |
```

* *LUI (Load Upper Immediate)*: places the 20-bit immediate value in the top 20 bits of the `rd` register and fills in the lowest 12 bits of `rd` with zeros.
	* rd = imm<sub>20</sub> << 12
* *AUIPC (Add Upper Immediate to PC)*: forms a 32-bit immediate value as above and places the `PC + the 32-bit offset` into the `rd` register.
	* rd = PC + (imm<sub>20</sub> << 12)

You will need to modify the following files to support the U-type instructions. Note that you need to add control signals & muxes to your previous design to complete Part I.

```
- src/module/simple_cpu.v
- src/module/control/control.v
- src/module/operation/immediate_generator.v
- src/module/memory/idex_reg.v
```

Once you implement the U-type instructions, you will be able to run `unit_tests/task6`.

## Part II: Measuring Baseline CPU Performance

The objective of Part II is to (1) make sure your pipelined CPU design from Part I (i.e., without a branch predictor) works okay for a set of **real** RV32I workloads and (2) measure the baseline CPU performance.

### Benchmark for Lab 3
The benchmark consists of the following workloads, which we will use to test out your submission; the unit tests are provided just for your convenience.

```
* bst_array
* fibo
* matmul
* prime_fact
* quicksort
* spmv
```

We have already included the workloads in `test.py`, so that you can simply run the benchmark using the test script as below. 

```
Linux> python test.py --test=benchmark
```

Note that your pipelined CPU (from the previous lab) may fail to run some of the workloads in the benchmark. If that happens, you **must fix the bugs** of your design.

### Measuring CPU Performance

To measure some of the statistics of the CPU, we also provide you with a simple hardware counter ( `src/module/utils/hardware_counter.v`).  You can use the hardware counter like the example shown below.

```verilog
<add below code to simple_cpu.v>
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Hardware Counters
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
wire [31:0] CORE_CYCLE;
hardware_counter m_core_cycle(
  .clk(clk),
  .rstn(rstn),
  .cond(1'b1),

  .counter(CORE_CYCLE)
);
```

Now, if you uncomment the `$display` tasks in `src/riscv_tb.v`  as shown below, the test script will print out the CORE_CYCLE statistics.

```verilog
  $display($time, " HARDWARE COUNTERS");
  $display($time, " CORE_CYCLE: %d", my_cpu.CORE_CYCLE);
  /*
  $display($time, " NUM_COND_BRANCHES: %d", my_cpu.NUM_COND_BRANCHES);
  $display($time, " NUM_UNCOND_BRANCHES: %d", my_cpu.NUM_UNCOND_BRANCHES);

  $display($time, " BP_CORRECT: %d", my_cpu.BP_CORRECT);
  $display($time, " BP_INCORRECT: %d", my_cpu.NUM_COND_BRANCHES - my_cpu.BP_CORRECT);
  */
```

After Part II, your baseline CPU needs to run all the workloads in the benchmark and report the performance numbers when running `test.py`. 

> You may want to checkpoint the baseline version for the performance comparison later.

## Part III: Add Branch Hardware to CPU

Now, you will need to implement the branch hardware in your CPU design. In this lab, we will implement the Gshare branch predictor and a (direct-mapped cache style) branch target buffer (BTB).

You will need to modify the following files to add branch hardware to your CPU.
```
- module/branch/branch_hardware.v
- module/branch/branch_target_buffer.v
- module/branch/gshare.v
- and others...
```

### Branch Hardware

The branch hardware needs to be accessed in the **instruction fetch** (IF) stage when the instruction is a **conditional branch** or a **(direct/indirect) jump**. To do so, you simply need to peek at the opcode of the instruction in the IF stage (sort of pre-decoding). Then, you need to access the branch predictor and the BTB.  

> In the reference design, as in the H&P textbook, the actual branch target address is computed in the EX stage, but is latched to the EX/MEM register. So, a branch is resolved in the MEM stage in the next cycle.

#### Gshare Branch Predictor

The Gshare branch predictor consists of the global branch history register (BHR) and the pattern history table (PHT). Recall that the BHR captures the history of the last `N`  branches (i.e., actual branch outcomes), which is XORed with PC to index into the PHT. Each entry in the PHT has a 2-bit **saturating counter**, and the number of entries in the PHT is 256 by default. Note that PC[1:0] is not used for indexing. 

##### Initialization
For an active low reset, 
> Each 2-bit counter in the PHT must be initialized to  `weakly NT (01)`.
> All the entries in the BHR must be initialized to zero (i.e., not taken).

##### Updating Branch Predictor
* Recall that the branch predictor must be updated with the **actual branch outcome** after the branch is resolved. In the implementation, you need to update the predictor according to the `update` , `actually_taken` , and `resovled_pc` signals.
* The branch predictor (BHR and PHT) **must be updated only for conditional branches**; no updates for unconditional branches (i.e., jumps).

#### Branch Target Buffer (BTB)

The branch target buffer stores the branch target address for a branch PC. Note that only **taken branches (or jumps)** are stored in the BTB. Each entry in the BTB consists of a `valid` bit, `tag` bits, and a 32-bit `branch target` address. The number of entries in the BTB is 256 by default. 

Our BTB is essentially a direct-mapped cache. For a branch PC, if we cannot find the entry in the BTB (i.e., a BTB miss), we just do PC+4 even if the branch predictor says it is 'predicted taken'.

##### Initialization
For an active low reset, 
> All the entries in the BTB must be invalid (0).

##### Updating BTB
* The BTB module updates the entry when the `update` signal is asserted.
* BTB must be updated with **the branch target address** for all **types of branches (conditional, jumps, etc.)**.
* If the conditional branch is actually not taken, we do not update the BTB.

### Next PC Selection

With a branch predictor, now there will be four possible next PC values, which you need to mux with.

* PC 
* PC + 4 
* Predicted Taken PC (from BTB)
* Misprediction recovery PC (actually taken PC)

### Measuring Branch Statistics

After completing Part III, you will need to measure the following branch statistics along with CPU cycles. 

* `NUM_COND_BRANCHES`: # of **conditional** branch instructions 
* `NUM_UNCOND_BRANCHES`: # of **unconditional** branch instructions
* `BP_CORRECT`: # of correct predictions for **conditional branches** 

To do so, uncomment the rest of `$display` tasks in `src/riscv_tb.v` , and implement them accordingly.
```verilog
  $display($time, " HARDWARE COUNTERS");
  $display($time, " CORE_CYCLE: %d", my_cpu.CORE_CYCLE);

  $display($time, " NUM_COND_BRANCHES: %d", my_cpu.NUM_COND_BRANCHES);
  $display($time, " NUM_UNCOND_BRANCHES: %d", my_cpu.NUM_UNCOND_BRANCHES);

  $display($time, " BP_CORRECT: %d", my_cpu.BP_CORRECT);
  $display($time, " BP_INCORRECT: %d", my_cpu.NUM_COND_BRANCHES - my_cpu.BP_CORRECT);
```

We will check the branch statistics to see if your branch hardware works correct.
